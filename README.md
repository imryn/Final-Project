# Kidin Touch

My final project in academic Tel-aviv Jafo. The project was developed for 4 month as web app. The app was programmed for both client and back end side. The client was programmed with HTML and CSS, JavaScript and Jquery. the back end was programmed with PHP, SQL. also bootstrap for responsive. 
I used several APIs such as Google Calander.
The idea of the project was to make better connection between parents and kindergarten teachers. There were several main key processes:

1. Kid protfolio - based privileges and predefined exceptions

2. Shopping list - is conducted according to the number of groups in the garden, while consolidating the quantities and synchronizing lists. A smart history-based purchase, a recommendation for a current purchase with respect to a previous purchase, an alert for exceeding the budget.

3. Presence management - initial update by the teacher and then in case of "non presence" SMS will be sent to parents.

4. A weekly schedule - planning a weekly schedule for the group's children in the kindergarten, including sleeping hours, meals to be served and activities to be carried out.

5. Generate compatible reports and charts:
- Allergy Report - the kindergarten staff and parents can choose an allergy from a list to identify the sensitivities of the kids.
- Attendance report - the teachers will be able to see the number of delays / subtractions of a particular child / children during the week / month, in order to identify the need to contact the parents of the child (s) in exceptional cases.
- Exception report - the kindergarten staff will be able to view comments for "exceptions" listed in all kindergarten files, while the child's parent will be able to view comments about the child only.

also used several APIs such as Google Calander.
